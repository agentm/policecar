# Police Car

The invention of nanoscale technology shook up many industrial processes but none as much as bullet-proofing. While military applications lagged behind, the civilian sector was quick to pick up on the advantages of a light-weight, stretchable, bullet-proof material.

Since the nanoscaling process had not been patented, the price per square meter of the material quickly dropped below a dollar and became a top-seller in stores selling it ostensibly as cooking aprons, but became a staple in depressed areas as a cheap means of stab- and bullet-proofing clothing. Police, aware of the development and also issued nanoscale vests replacing bulky kevlar vests, became fearful since it was now less likely to be able to kill an armed gunman with a standard pistol. Police-issued tasers, typically used as torture-based compliance devices similar to cattle prods, were also affected due to the high conductivity and impenetrability of the nanoscale shielding which closed the circuit which would otherwise have shocked the wearer. Police demanded ever-higher caliber and dangerous weapons which caused an escalation of violence and death, especially in black ghettos where police asserted themselves the most with "justifiable" killings. At the same time, the chance of surviving a police encounter increased across the country. To the dismay of Police Benevolent Associations, police conviction rates also increased across the country as survivors were able to film police encounters even after getting shot. The federal government attempted to pass legislation to ban the nanoscale material as a health risk, but the legislature's brazenness and obvious pandering garnered too much attention to pass as law.

In this environment of increasing mistrust between downtrodden people no longer dying from "failure to comply" and the government, one man had an idea to relax the tensions. Billionaire entrepreneur Simon Wisk realized that if he could create a definitively safe and bullet-proof buffer between police and their victims, police would be able to feel safer knowing that a bullet-proof partition protected them *and* the potential victims could be contained until cooler heads prevailed.

The first obvious application of this was for cars. Police had implemented quasi-legal checkpoints for years, especially in depressed neighborhoods, and had been caught executing unarmed black men. For police, shooting first had no serious consequences, so it became a natural reaction to shoot at people driving while on drugs, suffering from mental illness or seizures, or merely moving in an un-commanded way. Juries were hesitant to convict policemen who claimed to have seen a gun even when none existed so as to allow policemen to make "split-second" decisions. No such deference was offered to their victims.

Wisk believed that a bullet-proof barrier between the police and driver would eliminate the need for any split-second decisions, so he created an in-house team to develop the nanoscale material to be permanently affixed to cars. Along with this, he suggested that the car should have an integrated loudspeaker system to alert the police that the car was impervious to bullets from inside or out. Engineers refined the idea into a computer system which would detect the environment and make statements to the police accordingly.

The first prototype had been completed and Wisk, a black man, was eager to test it due to his own multiple, uncomfortable, and dangerous run-ins with police due to his preference to drive expensive vehicles in upscale neighborhoods. He had one of his own cars used for the prototype and he was pleasantly surprised that the performance and look of the vehicle were hardly affected. While the sheen of the car's paint was noticeably muted by the new material, hardly any other difference in the car's coat was visible. In testing, the nanoscales held up remarkably well with minor, repairable damage to body panels when shot.

Wisk then hired a constitutional law professor and a retired policeman to work over the scripted scenarios which the car was designed to handle during police encounters. After a few more iterations of tweaks and testing, Wisk and the consultants deemed the car worthy of a real encounter.

The lawyer and policeman consultants were logical choices for a the first, real encounter as they would be best suited to understand the capabilities of the car while also facing possibly confused and irritated police officers. With a final run-through, the consultants were outfitted with their own nanoscale, bulletproof suits just-in-case and headed out in the car to a local black ghetto neighborhood. It was decided that the retired policeman would drive since he would be most likely to face other officers. Mr. Wisk and the project's crew followed the car via remote monitors and waited for the inevitable encounter.

Luckily, they didn't have to wait long- daylight was running out.

Around 5 p.m. a squad car followed the car for a few blocks before activating its lights. The experimental car pulled to the side of the road, perhaps too eagerly; the car captured the surroundings with multiple cameras and police band radio recording. The recordings were captured live at Wisk's company headquarters. The cops sat in their vehicle for ten minutes, despite the fact that a license plate lookup is virtually instantaneous. Finally, the cop radioed in to report: "I've got two black males in an Audi. Nothing on the plates."

The cop in the driver's side eventually exited his vehicle and, with one hand on his unbuttoned holster, approached the car. The two men inside the car, after weeks of training, knew to keep their hands on the steering wheel and dashboard and stared straight ahead. "Keep your hands where I can see them!", the cop commanded as he waved a blinding flashlight at the occupants. "Roll down your window!"

In the meantime, the car had entered its protective mode.

"*ding* Hello officer," the soothing voice of a white woman boomed from the car, "the occupants of this vehicle reserve their right to remain silent and do not submit to a search. The windows of this vehicle do not roll down. This encounter is being recorded."

The police officer stepped back, gripping his handgun in anticipation. The stoic figures in the car didn't move.

"License and registration!" snarled the cop at the sealed window, thinking that the door would necessarily open if the windows did not. However, with a discrete button push on the steering wheel, the driver triggered a small compartment to open under the driver's side window. Inside the compartment was the requested paperwork along with a signed letter from Mr. Wisk allowing the two black men to borrow the vehicle.

The cop, clearly noticing but ignoring the paperwork, waved back to his car. A second officer, obese, begrudgingly emerged from the vehicle and stood behind his car door. Contrary to police protocol, he should have joined his partner from the start. Now two officers had their hands shaking over their holsters.

"Enough of this shit! Get out of the car, now! Hands in the air! No, on your head!" the thinner officer asserted.

As practiced, the retired police officer at the driver's seat, pushed a second button and the motorized driver side door slowly opened.

*ding* The driver is exiting the vehicle."

This was the riskiest part of the encounter and all four men felt it. Despite holding his hands at shoulder level at all times, the retired cop was not feeling confident as he exited the vehicle. He had not been on this end of such an encounter and he desperately wanted to pull out his own badge he had kept after retiring. Alas, according to the script, he would not be able to rely on the badge on that day.

The first officer, getting a good look at the driver for a second time, blinded the old cop intentionally with the flashlight again. Despite his age, the retired cop stood six feet tall, twisting his head to avoid the flashlight. The two officers stood at only five-at-and-half at most. The uncertainty of what was to come next was palpable, but the two consultants had had better training.

The first officer unholstered his weapon while the second officer fumbled with his own. At the same time, as soon as the car's camera system noticed the drawn weapon, the car emitted a two-toned warning- the retired cop shifted his hands to behind his head and slightly curled his torso down. An as-of-yet unseen belt pulled the retired cop into the vehicle, catching him on instantly-deployed airbags. The experimental car's door slammed shut as soon as the driver was back inside, before the first officer could point his weapon and order the black man to the ground. In the commotion, the second officer lost his balance and fell on his ass.

"*ding* Officer, the driver has been retracted for your protection. The car cannot be opened for thirty minutes."

The protected car's occupants now sat silently in their original positions with their hands forward.

Instinctively, the first officer called, "Gun!" and landed three shots to the side window of the car. The second officer had clamored to his feet by now and fired three shots but missed the car. The second officer grabbed his radio and yelled, "Shots fired! Shots fired!" The first officer retreated a few steps, but when nothing happened, stood in place, eyeing the car and its occupants. The reinforced window deflected the bullets, as in testing, and showed no damage whatsoever.

"*ding* Officer, this car has been disabled. It cannot leave and the occupants cannot exit. Please do not shoot the vehicle. All actions are being recorded."

A motorized screen whirred down from the car's rear bumper. The screen played back the past fifteen seconds of interaction to show the officers that they were indeed being recorded. The officers watched their past selves fire clumsily and fruitlessly at an armored car. Enraged, the first officer took aim and fired two rounds at the screen. The screen jiggled a bit, turned off, and retracted.

"Any more tricks, fuckwad?!" quipped the first officer, overconfidently, as he retreated to his squad car. The second officer looked stupidly on.

"*ding* Officer, this car has been disabled. It cannot leave and the occupants cannot exit..."

The first officer leaned into his vehicle to grab the shotgun designed to penetrate vehicles during felony stops.

"Maybe we should wait for backup..." asked the fat officer.

"They fuckin' think a talking car will save them from facing the law?!" responded the first officer, adding, "Did you activate your body cam?"

"Nope."

"Good- we'll do that trick to the dashcam later."

Over the squad car's amplifier, the first officer announced, "You have ten seconds to get out of the car!"

"*ding* Officer, this car has been disabled. It cannot..."

Annoyed by the repeated message, the first officer fired the shotgun from behind the squad car's door at the rear window. The attacked car's occupants jumped in surprise but otherwise remained in their positions, as trained. A few dents in the trunk's body panel showed that the shotgun pellets had indeed hit the car. Surveying the damage, or lack thereof, the first officer fumed!

"Let 'em have it!"

Both the first and second officers opened fire at the car. The first officer walked out from behind his door and approached the car, firing his final shots.

"I'm hit!" claimed the first officer as he fell to his side.

The second officer had already unloaded his magazine and remained behind his door, radioing "Officer down! Officer down!"

The officers peered through the dissipating smoke, examining the result of their handiwork. The shotgun had shredded the plastic taillights, the license plate was bent and hanging by a screw, one tire was flat, but the car's body panels had been only dented. Plastics with nanoscales had not held up well in firearms testing, so Wisk's engineers armored the housing behind the plastic lights. The officers were not entirely disheartened: broken taillights were a clear traffic violation.

The first officer had indeed been hit. He desperately wanted the men to be shooting back, but it turned out a piece of the license plate had sheared off and knicked his leg. The men inside the car were speaking to each other but their hands remained on the dashboard, as seen from multiple camera angles.

The bulletproof screen rolled down next to the damaged license plate, this time with a little difficulty as it rubbed against bent body panels. Again, it showed the last 15 seconds which mostly consisted of orange flashes and smoke.

The first officer jumped up and pretended it was necessary to hobble back behind his squad car's door. He radioed dispatch: "We need SWAT out here! Multiple armed targets!" He was right, but he didn't wait for a response from dispatch as he reached for more shotgun ammunition.

"Simmons!" squealed the second officer.

Shaken out his bloodlust by his partner, the first officer looked over. The second officer's gun was lowered but the first officer did not immediately see why. As his eyes adjusted to the darkness after being blinded by gun fire, both officers could see that dozens of people had amassed around them, some hidden behind buildings and trees, some standing in the open, all of them pointing camera phones at the officers.

The first officer pulled out his pistol. "Disperse! Can't you see this is an active shooting!" Some of the figures in the dark took a step back, but most did not. The officers heard a whirring sound above them and looked up. A camera drone was hovering just a few meters away. The first officer raised his pistol, but changed his mind and holstered it. The officers looked at each other, defeated.

The car had performed admirably.
